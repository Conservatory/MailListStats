1.3   + Portugues Brasil translation
      + added detection of some more email and news clients
      + updating cache file now possible (to run mls from .forward for example)
      + quiet mode (-q) - will print only errors (to stderr)
      + new graph - msgs written during months of year
      + new command-line option (-g) to specify which graphs to show
      + some examples of usage in "examples/" subdir
      * new translatable strings - Subject, Percent, Mailer
      * some code beautification (added some constants, comments, ...)
      * fixed bug in mailer detection (problem with Message-ID after X-Mailer)
      * format of cache files changed (you have to re-create them!)

1.2.2 + Serbian translation (iso-8859-2)
      + new command-line option -T to specify title (then only this will be
        printed as title thus omiting oldest & newest msg date)
      * optimized PHP wrapper, will use preg instead of ereg, if possible
      * mailers are also recognized in X-Newsreader header
      * added workaround to detect Pine mailer (search in Message-ID header)
      * some changes in regex's - better detection of "Re:"s in subject and
        mailer identification; changes won't show up in old cache files, you
	should re-generate them using this version of mls

1.2.1 * fixed bug in PHP wrapper causing incomplete output

1.2   + HTML output
      + PHP wrapper

1.1   + TOP table of used email clients (mailers)
      + TOP table of authors by total/average size of their messages
      + cache file support
      * source code beautification and optimization

1.0   + added support for MIME-encoded headers (mainly subject)
      * fixed invalid reporting of oldest message, because of presence of
        special folder-data message with "DON'T DELETE THIS MESSAGE -- FOLDER
	INTERNAL DATA" subject
      * code cleanup

0.8.1 + Italian language support (by Fabio Ferrero <ferrero@interim.it>)
      * increased buffer sizes, so it should run faster (at least under Win)

0.8   + option to specify how many TOP items to show (e.g. TOP 25 or TOP 5)
      + will print date of oldest & newest message
      + TOP table of quoting
      * changed default language to English
      * changed title text configuration (see README)
      * under Windows, consumed CPU time won't be printed (DJGPP doesn't
        support it)

0.7   + will show elapsed execution time, consumed CPU time
      + verbose mode
      * cleaned sources - less Slovak variables and comments
      * fixed some lang issues in output

0.0.1 * parsing options, reading input file, counting bytes



BUGS/TODO
~~~~~~~~~
* doesn't support header fields splitted to more lines
  (you can use formail(1) to put them to one line before using MLS)
* charset conversion in MIME-decoding
* more stats
* file locking
