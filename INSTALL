 How to compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Under Linux you should have no problems, just run
    make           -- will compile the sources
    make install   -- will install binary and man page
  in the directory with source files. You may want to change something in
  Makefile. By default, it's optimised using -O3, but you can change it.
  Default install dir is /usr/local/bin/ for binary and /usr/local/man/man1
  for man page.
  Other targets are:
    make clean     -- will remove files created during compilation
    make uninstall -- will remove installed binary and man page

* Windows
  You can just download the pre-compiled version, which should be OK for you.
  It's significantly slower, but it's issue of DJGPP.
  With DJGPP installed, you should have no problems with compilation, just
  edit Makefile and change name of target file to "mls.exe", so that DJGPP
  will know you want to produce normal executable file. But as I noticed,
  it is not necessary with recent version of DJGPP, so do it only if it doesn't
  work without it.

* PHP wrapper - see file README
* Examples    - see dir  examples/

 How to add another language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* You can just translate everything in mls_lang.h and send it to me and I will
  include it in next release.

* Or can add another language as specified in mls_lang.h, but you will need to
  change also mls.c
  * add line for your language to parameters-parsing switch(c) - it's at the
    beginning of main()

* Sorry for such a bad implementation, but I have no time to learn gettext()
  and it has disadvantage that it needs specials files to be located somewhere.
